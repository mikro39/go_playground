# go_playground
This repo serves no purpose other than as a location where i am putting go lang files that i am tinkering with and using to learn from. These files are pushed from my home Windows PC, and my M1 Macbook Pro. I might also try tinkering with linux dev on Go as well since it is so freaking easy.

# Usage
Honestly, feel free to look at them as a reference, but i wouldn't advise using them for any other purpose.

## Commonly used commands
Go run x.go - runs the go file x.go
go build x.go - builds the executable x.go
go install x.go - sends the x.go to the .\bin

# Cheers
Cheers guys!
